This script calculates correlations between features, correlations between each invididual feature and the kinetic constant, t-SNE and PCA analyses of features, linear fits between the input features and the kinetic constant, and sigmoid/tanh fits between the input features and the kinetic constants.
<ul>
<li>"choose what to calculate" sets which of these is calculated in a single run</li>
<li>The number of pca components to plot is set in "look at the first four components"</li>
<li>The features that should be used for the fits is set in "pick components for the fit"</li>
<li>Different choices for tanh/sigmoid fits are set in "pick tanh/sigmoid feature choices to plot"</li>
</ul>
